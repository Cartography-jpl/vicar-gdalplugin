To make a RPM for installing as a redhat package, we can do the following:

1. Do a configure using the configure found in this file.
2. make distcheck
3. cp vicar-gdalplugin-1.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
4. rpmbuild -ba <srcdir>/vicar-gdalplugin.spec

We then have the RPMs ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/vicar-gdalplugin-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm and
~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/vicar-gdalplugin-1.0-1.src.rpm which can be copied to a repository.
